Scripts and support files for setting up a virtual environment. Assumes dev machine has pip and virtualenv installed.

Run "./create.sh <dirname>" where <dirname> is the name of the virtualenv directory you want to install the virtualenv too (doesn't have to exist initially).

TODO: Check out a copy of the final project inside the virtualenv as well or symlink the project into this directory.

To use the virtual environment use the following commands in the virtual env directory:
   - ". ./bin/activate" <-- activates the virtual environment, a prefix should be added to your bash specifier
   - "deactivate" <-- deactivates the virtual environment
